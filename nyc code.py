# Letâ€™s explore flights from NYC to Seattle. Use the flights dataset to answer the following some questions.
# 
# (a) How many flights were there from NYC airports to Seattle in 2013?

# In[36]:

flights_df = pd.DataFrame(flights_df)
# NYC Airports are JFK, EWR and LGA 
# subsetting the flights from these airports to Seattle (SEA)
sea_flights = flights_df[((flights_df.origin == 'JFK') | (flights_df.origin == 'EWR') 
                | (flights_df.origin == 'LGA')) & (flights_df.dest == 'SEA')]
len(sea_flights)


# - There were 3923 flights that flew from NYC airports (JFK, EWR, LGA) to Seattle in 2013. 

# (b) How many airlines fly from NYC to Seattle?

# In[37]:

len(sea_flights.carrier.unique())


# - There are 5 airlines that fly from NYC to Seattle based on our data

# (c) How many unique air planes fly from NYC to Seattle?

# In[38]:

# Every plane would have a unique tail number
len(sea_flights.tailnum.unique()) # Calculating number of unique air planes


# - There were 936 unique airplanes operating between NYC and Seattle in 2013.

# (d) What is the average arrival delay for flights from NC to Seattle?

# In[39]:

sea_flights.arr_delay.mean() # mean arrival delay


# - The average arrival delay for flights from NYC to Seattle in 2013 was -1.099 mins, ie, on an average the flights from NYC to Seattle arrived 1.099 mins before their scheduled arrival time. 

# (e) What proportion of flights to Seattle come from each NYC airport?

# In[40]:

# Creating new data frame with number of flights grouped by NYC airport
prop = pd.DataFrame(sea_flights.groupby('origin')['origin'].count()) 
prop.columns = ['count'] # Renaming column name to count of flights
sum = prop.sum() # Total number of flights
prop['proportion'] = prop.apply(lambda count: 100*count/float(count.sum())) # percentage flights / total
prop


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# In 2013, the flights from NYC airports to Seattle were split as follows:
# 1. 46.67% from the EWR airport (Newark Liberty International Airport) 
# 2. 53.32% from the JFK airport (John F. Kennedy International Airport)
# 3. 0% from the LGA airport (LaGuardia Airport) 

# Flights are often delayed. We consider the following questions exploring delay patterns.
# 
# (a) Which date has the largest average departure delay? Which date has the largest average arrival delay?

# In[41]:

# Adding the Date column by concatenating yyyy-mm-dd
flights_df['date'] = flights_df['year'].astype(str) + "-" + flights_df['month'].astype(str) + "-" + flights_df['day'].astype(str)
# Creating a new dataframe with departure delay averages by date
avg_by_date = pd.DataFrame(flights_df.groupby('date').mean()) # Group by date for mean of all columns

# Finding the date with the maximum average departure delay
print 'The date with largest average departure delay is'
print avg_by_date.sort_values(['dep_delay'], ascending = False)['dep_delay'].head(1)


# Finding the date with the maximum average arrival delay
print '\nThe date with largest average arrival delay is'
print avg_by_date.sort_values(['arr_delay'], ascending = False)['arr_delay'].head(1)


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - The date with Largest average departure delay is 2013-3-8 (8th March, 2013) with an average dep delay of 83.53 mins
# - The date with Largest average arrival delay is 2013-3-8 (8th March, 2013) with an average arr delay of 85.86 mins

# (b) What was the worst day to fly out of NYC in 2013 if you dislike delayed flights?
# 

# In[42]:

# 1. Largest average departure delay in a day.
# Finding the date with the maximum average departure delay
print 'The date with largest average departure delay is:'
print avg_by_date.sort_values(['dep_delay'], ascending = False)['dep_delay'].head(1)

# 2. Most number of delayed flights in a day.
# Subsetting data to find only flights in a day that are delayed (ie. Dep_delay > 0 mins)
dep_delay = flights_df[flights_df['dep_delay'] > 0]
dep_delay_agg = pd.DataFrame(dep_delay.groupby('date').count())
dep_delay_agg.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'count'}, inplace=True)
print '\nMost number of delayed flights in a day:'
print dep_delay_agg.sort_values(['count'], ascending = False)['count'].head(1)

# 3. Highest departure delay of a flight in a day. 
dep_delay = dep_delay.set_index(['date'])
print "\nHighest delay in the departure of a flight (in mins) was on:"
print dep_delay.sort_values(['dep_delay'], ascending = False)['dep_delay'].head(1)

# 4. Highest % of flights delayed in a given day.
flights_grouped = flights_df.groupby('date').count()
flights_grouped.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'count'}, inplace=True)
print "\nHighest % of flights delayed in a given day was on:"
print (dep_delay_agg['count'] / flights_grouped['count'] * 100).sort_values(ascending = False).head(1)


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# So this is a tricky one -- disliking delayed flights and the worst day to fly out can be a little subjective, and interpretted in different ways. 
# For instance:
# 1. Largest average departure delay. 
# 2. Most number of delayed flights in a day. 
# 3. Highest departure delay in a day.
# 4. Highest % of flights delayed in a given day. 
# 
# So let's look at all of them. 
# 
# - If a person dislikes delayed flights based on largest average departure delays then the worst day to fly out of NYC in 2013 was <b>2013-3-8</b> with the average delay in depature time of <b>83.53 mins</b> for all flights put together.
# 
# - If a person dislikes delayed flights such that there were most number of delayed flights in a given day then the worst day to fly out of NYC in 2013 was <b>2013-12-23</b> which featured <b>674 delayed flights in a single day</b>. 
# 
# - If a person dislikes delayed flights such that a flight had the highest value in mins for its delay then the worst day to fly out would be <b>2013-1-9</b> since the person could get on a flight that was <b>delayed by 1301 minutes (~21 hours).</b>
# 
# - If a person dislikes delayed flights given the highest percentage of flights delayed in a given day of the total flights departed, the worst day to fly out would be <b>2013-12-23 as 68.43% of flights that flew that day were delayed</b>. 
# 

# (c) Are there any seasonal patterns in departure delays for flights from NYC?

# In[43]:

# Exploring the seasonal patterns in average departure delay in mins by Month
flights_df.head()
matplotlib.style.use('ggplot') 
plt.plot(flights_df.groupby('month')['dep_delay'].mean())
plt.xlabel('Months', size = 12)
plt.ylabel('Avg Departure delay in mins', size = 12)
plt.title('Avg Departure Delay in mins by Month')
plt.show()

# Exploring the seasonal patterns in total number of delayed by Month
plt.plot(dep_delay.groupby('month').count())
plt.xlabel('Months', size = 12)
plt.ylabel('Total Number of Delayed Flights', size = 12)
plt.title('Total Number of Delayed Flights by Month')
plt.show()


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Yes, there seem to be some evident patterns in the flight departure delays. Mostly, the holiday season shows spike in the mean flight departure delay time during the months of June, July and December. These months have the highest average of delayed mins. Also, the second graph shows the total number of flights delayed in a given month and again July and December seem to stand out with most number of delayed flights in total. This ties back directly to the Summer and winter break that post people take during these months of the year in terms of season.

# (d) On average, how do departure delays vary over the course of a day?

# In[44]:

# Exploring data for departure delay trends over the course of a day
dep_delay_hour = pd.DataFrame(flights_df.groupby('hour')['dep_delay'].mean()) # Group by hour
dep_delay_hour.index.name = None

# Plotting Data
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.bar(range(25), dep_delay_hour.dep_delay, 0.70)
plt.xlabel('Hour of the Day', size = 12)
plt.ylabel('Avg Departure Delay', size = 12)
plt.title('Avg Departure Delay over the course of a day')
plt.show()

# Calculating the number of flights by hour of the day
count_flights_hour = flights_df.groupby('hour').count()
count_flights_hour.rename(columns={'Unnamed: 0': 'count'}, inplace=True)
count_flights_hour.index.name = None
print 'Number of flights by hour of the day:\n', count_flights_hour['count']


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - From the plot it is clear that the delays are more prominent during the night mainly between 10 PM and 4 AM (with a peak in the 3rd hour of the day). A possible reason for this could be low visibility condition during these hours or other factors like fog or bad weather conditions. The delay in flight departures go down significantly in other hours of the day. 
# - Also, another point to note is that the number of flights in these late hours are fewer than others -- this is one possible reason why the average of the departure delay times is higher during 10 PM - 4 AM (fewer flights and most flights delayed: Example: Only 11 flights around 3 AM).

# Which flight departing NYC in 2013 flew the fastest?

# In[45]:

# Assuming the degree of fastness corresponds to the speed of the flight. 
flights_df['speed_in_mph'] = flights_df.distance/(flights_df.air_time/60)
x = ['date','carrier','tailnum','flight','origin','dest','air_time','distance','speed_in_mph']
flights_df.sort_values('speed_in_mph',ascending = False)[x].head(1)


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# - Flight 1499 with Tail number N666DN traveling between La Guardia Airport (LGA) in NYC to Hartsfieldâ€“Jackson Atlanta International Airport was the fastest in terms of speed in miles per hour. 
# - The flight covered the distance of 762 miles in 65 mins with an average speed of 703.38 miles per hour.

# Which flights (i.e. carrier + flight + dest) happen every day? Where do they fly to?

# In[46]:

# Concatenating the flight details together as carrier + flight + dest for our analysis
flights_df['flight_combo'] = flights_df['carrier'].astype(str) + ' ' + flights_df['flight'].astype(str) + ' ' + flights_df['dest'].astype(str)
flights_df.head()

# Just checking the dates that are present in the dataset and getting a count
dates = pd.DataFrame(flights_df.date.unique())
dates.rename(columns={0:'date'}, inplace = True)
print "\nFor a flight to fly every day, it needs to fly these number of days: ", dates.date.count()

# Counting number of days a given flight combo flies
flights_rep = flights_rep.groupby('flight_combo').count().sort_values('count', ascending = False) 
flights_rep.reset_index(level=0, inplace=True)

# Getting only flights that fly on all days (365 unique days of the current dataset)
flights_all_days = flights_rep[flights_rep['count'] == 365]['flight_combo']

# ---------------------
# Research Question: 
# 
# "In 2013, which airlines and airports were best enablers of positive experience for NY flyers and how can users make smarter decisions for better traveling experiences in the future?"
# 
# 
# Positive experience depends on various factors but from the dataset we explore the following paramters to define a user's experience with an airline or an airport - depature delays, arrival delays, covering more distance in less time (higher speed), etc.
# 
#     1. Best Airports for NY Flyers: The first plot shows the best destinations to travel to from NY based on the delays in arrival, depature and also the number of flights operating. 
#     Inferences from the graph are as follows:
#         - The top 5 destinations to travel to: LEX, PSP, SNA, STT, ANC
#         - The worst 5 destinations to travel to: TYS, JAC, OKC, TUL, CAE
#     
#     2. Best Carriers overall: The second plot shows the carriers that operate flights from NY to different destinations. We look at aggregate data to see which carriers have the best performance in the least departure delays, least arrival delays and also the avg speed and the total number of flights. Inferences from the graph:
#         - The top 5 carriers to fly with: US, HA, AS, AA, DL
#         - The worst carriers to fly with: WN, FL, YV, EV, F9
#         
#     3. We also look at the best carrier to choose when flying to any one of the "specific" 105 destinations. This way, the user can smartly pick one of the 15 carriers while traveling to a given destination of their choice provided it has the least time lost (the sum of avg arrival delay and avg departure delay for that specific destination). The data is shown above.
#     
# Important Note: The limitation of this research is that we assume that the positive experience of the flyer only depends on arrival and departure delays, while there might be a lot of other factors to define customer experience when flying with an airline to a specific destination.

# --------------
# In this final piece we study relationships between different weather factors and its effect on the departure delays throughout 2013. 
# 
# First, we plot all the weather factors (Temperature, Visibility, Dewpoint, Precipitation, Pressure, Humidity, Wind Speed, Wind Gust and Wind Direction) against departure delays. 
# 
# Interpretting the graphs and regression models:
# 
# 1. Temp vs. Departure Delay: 
#     - For every 1 degree F increase in the temperature, the departure delay increases by 0.080 mins. 
#     - On a day when the temperature is 0F, the avg dep delay is expected to be around 10.72.
# 2. Visibility vs. Departure Delay:
#     - For every 1 mile increase in visibility, the dep delay decreases by 3.40 mins.
#     - On a day with 0 mile visibility, the dep delay is expected to be 46.57 mins. 
# 3. Dewpoint Vs. Departure Delay:
#     - For every 1 degree increase in dewpoint value, the dep delay increases by 0.15 mins. 
#     - For a day with dewpoint value as 0, the dep delay is expected to be 8.63 mins. 
# 4. Precipitation Vs. Departure Delay:
#     - For every 1 inch increase in precipitation in a day, the avg departure delay is expected to increase by 447.58 mins. (ie, 1 inch is considerable rain for NY)
#     - On a day with 0 inch rain, the departure delay is expected to be around 13.86 mins. 
# 5. Humidity Vs. Departure Delay:
#     - For every 1 unit increase in the value of humidity, the dep delay is expected to increase by 0.387 mins. 
#     - On a day with no humidity, the departure delay is expected to be -9.15 mins (ie, early departure).
# 6. Pressure Vs. Departure Delay:
#     - For every 1 unit increase in pressure, the dep delay is expected to decrease by 0.49 mins. 
#     - On a day with 0 pressure, 520.10 mins is the expected departure delay (although this situation may not be possible)
# 7. Wind Speed Vs. Departure Delay:
#     - For every 1 mph increase in the wind speed, the departure delay increases by 0.03 mins. 
#     - On a day with no wind (wind 0 mph), the departure delay is expected to be 14.87 mins. 
# 8. Wind Gust Vs. Depature Delay:
#     - For every 1 mph increase in the wind gust value, the dep delay increases by 0.02 mins. 
#     - For 0 mph wind gust, the departure delay is expected to be 14.87 mins. 
# 9. Wind Direction Vs. Departure Delay:
#     - For every 1 degree change in the direction of the wind, the dep delay decreases by 0.025 mins. 
#     - On a day when the wind is flowing in 0 degrees, the departure delay is expected to be 20.18 mins. 
#     
# -----------------------------
# From the above interpretations, Visibility, precipitation and temperature seem to be most interesting. So we take a step further and construct a multivariate linear regression model and also plot a bubble chart showing all these factors on a monthly scale. 
#     
#     Interpretation: dep_delay ~ temp + visib + precip
#     - Holding precipitation and visibility constant, for every 1 degree fahrenheit increase in temperature leads to an increase in departure delays by 0.10 mins. 
#     - Holding temperature and precipitation constant, for every 1 mile increase in visibility leads to a drop in departure delays by -2.95 mins. 
#     - For every 1 inch increase in precipitation, the departure delays increase drastically by 222.95 mins, holding other two parameters constant.
#     
# - From the bubble chart, its clear that the months of December, June and July had the highest departure delays. The month of June had most precipitation (the area of bubble denotes the precipitation levels), July had the highest temperature and December had low temperatures and good precipitation.
#     
# The limitations of the above models are many, the statistical significance of many model parameters may be low and need to combine other factors to get a better prediction. 
# 
# On a higher abstract note, weather had some correlation with the departure delays of flights from NY airports in 2013 as shown by the graphics and relationships above.
